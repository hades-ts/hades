Hey all. 

There's a new docs site... and you're looking at it!

And now I'm gonna nerd out about it. :)


## Docusaurus
The new site is built ontop of [Docusaurus V2](https://docusaurus.io).

Docusaurus is a pretty great static site generator from Facebook. It's basically NextJS with the SSR ripped out.

Here are some highlights:

- Normal React TSX development for pages
- MDX support for content (Markdown + React)
- Has a nice blog
- Offline search
- Powerful automatic sidebar support
- Easy to add docs for new tools, libs and plugins

If you're just trying to contribute documentation or an article it doesn't get easier:
- edit markdown files under the [docs/](https://github.com/hades-ts/hades/tree/main/apps/docs/docs) or [blog/](https://github.com/hades-ts/hades/tree/main/apps/docs/apps)
- submit a pull request

That's it!
