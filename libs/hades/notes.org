* Command Processing

Overview:

- Commands and their arguments are captured via decorator metadata.
- On startup, the commands and arguments are collected via metadata reflection.
- During container binding, a CommandFactory is bound for every command.
- When a command is dispatched:
    - Try to resolve a factory from the container
    - If the factory is found:
        - The factory creates a sub-container for the execution
        - The factory runs an installer (binder) for each command argument
        - It then resolves an instance of the Command class
        - The Command instance is injected with the CommandContext and any parsed arguments
