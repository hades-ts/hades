description: Making nouns from verbs

---

The words `lo` and `ku` take a verb and produce a noun from it's `x1` place:

```
[lo <VERB> ku] = [NOUN from VERB X1]
```

Example:

```
    <vecnu>     = <x1 sells item x2 to buyer x3 for price x4>
[lo <vecnu> ku] = [ a seller ]
```

Any verb can be used with `lo` and `ku`, even complex verb phrases.
