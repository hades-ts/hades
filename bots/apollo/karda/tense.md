title: Tenses
description: Past, present and future

---

Tense words (`CA`) _take a verb_ and produce a _tensed version_:

```
<CA <VERB>> = <TENSED VERB>
```

The tense words are:

```
pu: past
ca: present
ba: future
```

Example:

```
{ [mi] <ba <citka>> [lo <plise> ku] }

I will eat the apple.
```
